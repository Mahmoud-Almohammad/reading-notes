# What is Git?

\* Git is a version control system that stored erery snapshot in the database, that when user change any thing in his or her project and commit it then Git is going to save this changes and still have the older versions for the user so he or she can restore them any time.

Also git is a local version control system that, because git is relying on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources.

**But is that mean that we can't host or share our projects that we worked on on git?**

#### That's not true, luckily we can do some thing calld "clone" to our projects to make it hosted through the internet.

\* Here is some of the commands that we can make in git:
 | Name of the command              |       What this command do                     |
 |----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
 | git status                       | To determine the state of files                |
 | git add filename                 | To add a new file                              | 
 | git commit -m "any messege"      | To commit the changes that we make             | 
 | git clone the repo URl           | Create a copy of an existing Git repository from a particular server |
