# Control flow

## Control flow is the order in which the computer excutes stetement in a script, like for example when the code is running,it running form the firt code to the second to the third one.... to the last one unless there is a frequently code that changes the control flow like conditions and loops

## There are many control structures, including conditions and loops, and there are some parts of the code doesn't work until the condition or thisloop evaluate to true(for example)

        if (isEmpty(field)) {
         promptUser();
        } else {
         submitForm();
        }

## in the example above the the code will run and it going to submit only **if** the user doesn't leave the field empty, but if the user left the field empty the code will run the first condition and it's going to prompt the user and that will creat a loop(the code will run the same code over and over again until the user fill the field with anything)
