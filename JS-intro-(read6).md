# How computer works.

## There are four fundemintal tasks that all comouters in the world do:

**1- Take input** <br>
**2- Store the information** <br>
**3- Processing this information** <br>
**4- Output the results** <br>

## AS we all know that every computer works on ones and zeros and we call this (Binary), but now nobody is working and dealing with these ones and zeros, insted we work on programming and coding software that translate to ones and zeros.

## Inside computer are electric wires and circuits that's hold all the information in this computer, and every wire do a single jop and give us one of two ansewrs either yes or no/true or false/on or off/0 or 1 and this on/off state in a single wire called a **bit**, and this is the smallest piece in computer to store information.
